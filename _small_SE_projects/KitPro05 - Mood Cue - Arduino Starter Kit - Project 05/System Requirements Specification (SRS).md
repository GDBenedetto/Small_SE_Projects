# System Requirements Specification (SRS)
## Mood Cue (Arduino Starter Kit – Project 05)

---

## 1. Introduction
This document specifies the system requirements for the *Mood Cue* system.  
The system demonstrates the interaction between an analog input device and a mechanical actuator.  
This specification follows INCOSE guidelines and conforms to IEEE 29148:2018 and ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288.

---

## 2. Purpose
The purpose of the system is to provide a mechanical indicator for mood representation.  
A potentiometer allows the user to adjust a servo-driven pointer, mapping human input to a physical output.

---

## 3. System Overview
The system consists of:
- 1 analog input (potentiometer)
- 1 actuator (servo motor)
- 1 microcontroller

The potentiometer value (0–1023) is mapped to a servo angle (0–179°), representing a continuous mood scale.

## 4. System Context
The system operates on an Arduino Uno.  

- **User** interacts via a potentiometer  
- **System** processes analog input  
- **Actuator** (servo) provides physical feedback  
- Optional: Serial interface for diagnostics

## 8. Non-Functional Requirements

- **NFR-001**: The system shall respond to input changes within 100 ms.  
- **NFR-002**: The servo control signal shall maintain stable timing (PWM consistency).  
- **NFR-003**: The system shall operate continuously without failure under normal conditions.  
- **NFR-004**: The system shall be implementable on standard Arduino hardware without additional libraries beyond Servo.h.  
- **NFR-005**: The system shall maintain readability and simplicity suitable for educational purposes.

## 9. Assumptions and Constraints

- The system uses fixed pins (A0, D9).  
- The servo operates within a range of 0–179°.  
- Power is supplied via USB or equivalent stable source.  
- No advanced filtering or smoothing is required (basic implementation).
